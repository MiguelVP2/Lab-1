# Lab-1

 The name of this game Cats Looking for diamonds on rockets.

 The intent of the game is to dodge meteors, in search of diamonds among the cosmos. (there are no diamonds)

 This is an alternate timeline in which instead of sending monkeys into space, NASA and other global space organizations send cats. This backfires when cats found out they don't need air to breath and became sentient. They now search the cosmos cursed to find diamonds, it is the only thing that brings them joy any more

 The mechanics are such that you can move left and right with the mouse to dodge meteors.

 Almost entirely 8-bit. Very low res.

 Joys - c# not that bad, pretty easy honestly.
 Struggles - rescaling canvas and camera, remembering which buttons to refer scripts to.

 a paragraph discussing the contributions of each team member to the final game.


Kaden - I found most of the sprites. Along with just trying to understand everything that happens in unity. I changed the GameManager script to work for the objects in our game. I also set up the meteors so that they respawn, and travel along different trajectories.

Miguel - Initially, I first made the "rocket", and put the three "meteors" in
where they would fall. I also made some of the scripts, such as the movement for the rocket, and the drop for the meteors. Furthermore, I fixed a few issues that were happening that caused errors.
